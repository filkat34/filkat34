## About me

Currently transitioning into software development, I am enrolled in a training program in web and mobile programming. My initial background, which includes a PhD in Comparative Literature, a teaching certification in French literature, and degrees in Cognitive Science and Translation, enabled me to teach for over ten years in secondary schools and at the university level. 

Today, I am seeking to join a company where I can leverage my ability to learn quickly, solve complex problems, and collaborate. My hybrid profile allows me to bring a unique perspective on user experience, interfaces, and user needs, particularly within the EdTech sector.
